            <h4>Welcome to the Jons Junior Secondary School website. I hope that you will enjoy finding out about our school and the variety of opportunities offered to our students and their families.</h4>
            <br>
  <p>At Jons Junior Secondary School , our foremost priority is to educate tomorrowâ€™s leaders, by infusing them with the life skills to master the challenges posed by an ever-changing world.</p>
  <p>In order to produce young people with confidence to shape the future, our teachers view each member of our student body as a unique individual. Being a relatively small school, we are able to discover and nurture the strengths and talents of each one of our students. At the same time, we are large enough to offer our students the advantages of an all-encompassing education that provides them with a wide range of subject choice, as well as a diverse range of sporting and cultural opportunities. The infrastructure of the Jons Junior Secondary School family-like environment facilitates the essential one-on-one tuition and hands-on coaching that allow everyone to thrive. We pride ourselves on being able to provide everyone with opportunities to participate both within the classroom and beyond its confines; said participation, in turn, encourages meaningful personal relationships, teamwork and commitment to causes beyond the pursuit and attainment of individual prestige.</p>
  <p>At Jons Junior Secondary School , we believe that achievement is not defined solely by an impressive academic performance. We are of the opinion that achievement must also be measured in relation to the emotional and social well-being of our students. Being part of our close-knit community instils in our young people a unique understanding of common mission, a sense of belonging and an empowering belief in self-worth. The results are consistently impressive academic, sporting and cultural performances that highlight our ability to deliver a quality holistic education; this equips our students with that all-important competitive edge, which in the long term enables them to excel in every sphere of life.</p>
  <p>My vision for the future of this school has been built on the long-standing foundation of camaraderie, mutual respect and trust that enables members of this caring Jons family to forge lifelong friendships. Along the years, this foundation has been shaped by the unequivocal support that has always connected teachers to students, and students to their peers. I am committed to nurturing and perpetuating these fundamental components of our culture, so that we can continue to produce students who ultimately become highly successful contributors to the global society.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in finding out more about Jons Junior Secondary School , I invite you to visit our campus, meet us and experience, in person, what we have to offer.</p>
